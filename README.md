# CarRecommendationSystem
Recommender system (as a .NET Forms application, with machine learning component made via ML .NET) for user profiling and proposing the most suitable cars.

## Project description

This application was developed as part of my graduate thesis which was in domain of recommender systems. The application performs user profiling and, based on his preferences, suggests to the user top car recommendations that might suit him.

Application has two components that generate generations:</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;    a) **custom made scoring algorithm** and</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;    b) **ML model crated via ML .NET machine learning framework**.
